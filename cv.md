### About me:
I'm just starting my way in Front-End developing and I would like learn more and more about this direction. My goal is to become a Middle Front-End Developer until the end of 2021.
### My skills:
Basics in Python, C++, C#, JS, HTML and CSS.
### Code example:
Function, that tells you the is word palindrome or not:
```sh
function isPalindrome(line) {
  return (line == line.toString().split('').reverse().join(''));
}
```
### Experience:
I have experience in making simple Windows Forms apps, connecting it to data base and making a data base using MySql or Microsoft SQL with primar keys, triggers etc. You can find my VS project in this [link](https://kairu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/khusnulgatinbr_stud_kai_ru/EubWOm7eUWRPsKwnKVCB560BR_3aNonO8efixb2X1aXBIQ?e=d0q8Oa).
### Education:
I am a student of KNRTU KAI n.a. A. N. Tupolev, my speciality is applied mathematics and computer science. I don't really like my speciality that's why I'm selfeducating and taking part in some free courses or intensives (never finished one yet :D).
### English level:
I guess my level is close to intermediate, never passed a test, but I practice my english by watching YouTube, films or serials, reading articles on the Internet and also speaking with my teammates in online games voice chat.
